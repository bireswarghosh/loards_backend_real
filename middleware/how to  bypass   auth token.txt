To add more routes that don't need authentication, you have two options:

Option 1: Add to the path checker middleware
Open path-checker.middleware.js

Add a new check for your route:

// Check for your new route
if (fullPath.includes('/your-new-route')) {
  req.isYourNewRoute = true;
}

Copy
javascript
Then update auth.middleware.js to check for this flag:

// Skip auth for your new route
if (req.isYourNewRoute) {
  return next();
}

Copy
javascript
Option 2: Add directly to auth middleware
Simply add your new route to the existing conditions:

// Skip auth for patient-auth endpoints and your new route
if (req.isPatientAuthRoute || 
    req.path === '/patient-auth/signup' || 
    req.path === '/patient-auth/signin' || 
    req.path === '/api/v1/patient-auth/signup' || 
    req.path.startsWith('/patient-auth/profile/') ||
    req.path.startsWith('/your-new-route/')
    ) {
  return next();
}

Copy
javascript
This way, any route that starts with /your-new-route/ will bypass authentication.
